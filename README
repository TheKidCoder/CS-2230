I created this repo for future students and teachers alike to access all the work I have done in CS 2230.

This repo will include mostly C and SPARC assembly only.  Might through in some goodies aswell!

Enjoy, and remember, academic honesty is paramount!  You may use my code as an example, not cut and paste!
